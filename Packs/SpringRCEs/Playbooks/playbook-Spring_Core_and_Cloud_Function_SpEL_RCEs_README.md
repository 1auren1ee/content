On March 29, 2022, information about a 0-day vulnerability in the popular Java library Spring Core appeared on Twitter.

Spring Framework is an extremely popular framework used by Java developers to build modern applications. If you rely on the Java stack, it is very likely that your development teams use Spring. In some cases, a single specially crafted request is enough to exploit the vulnerability.

Later, it was discovered that these are two separate vulnerabilities, one in Spring Core and the other in Spring Cloud Function:

* RCE in "Spring Core" is a severe vulnerability, aka Spring4Shell.
* RCE in "Spring Cloud Function", aka CVE-2022-22963.

Spring Cloud Function unaffected versions:

* 3.1.7
* 3.2.3
